                            If there's one New Year's resolution that will help you the most in the long run, it's
                            making
                            a vow to save more money.<br>
                            Before you head back to the office in January, outline a rough budget that works for you —
                            and
                            make a plan for how you'll stick to it. Budgeting apps can help you do this as painlessly as
                            possible. And supercharge your shopping habits by rethinking when and how you buy things for
                            your home and family; often, there are savings you're leaving on the table.

                        <p class="resolution-title-description">January is the perfect time of year to snuggle up with a
                            new book. To keep yourself
                            accountable
                            all year long, why not link up with friends and peers to connect over the best pages you've
                            read? Our Good Housekeeping Book Club can help you get started on this and, together, you'll
                            have a clear snapshot of how many books you'll end up finishing before the year's out.</p>

                            foods. After all, variety is the spice of life. This year, choose an easy dinner recipe

                            does stress you out, says
                            mindfulness expert
                            Pedram Shojai, author of Focus: Bringing Time, Energy, and Money Into Flow. "If your
                            focus is
                            fragmented, you'll likely find yourself getting anxious as new items come up when
                            old ones are
                            still incomplete," he says.
                            <br>
                            Instead, he suggests, organize your activities into chunks of time, such as kid time
                            and cooking
                            time, and then "commit to being focused in those allotted minutes and see what
                            happens." It'll
                            help stop you from overthinking everything.

                            and build muscle. Plus, they work well with many of the other gadgets in your
